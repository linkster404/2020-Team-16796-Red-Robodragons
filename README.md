# 2020-Team-16796-Red-Robodragons
Team 16796 Code for the year 2020.
Basically this is the code for our 2020-2021 year in robotics
it inculdes our autonoumus code (which does use human control)
and our tele-op code(which allows a person to control the robot)
I'm a kinda new to this making read-me files, so I don't know if this is correct
